### Guides

- [Write a memory dump in an Azure App Service](write-dump-azure-app-service.md)

## Write a memory dump

The first step is to write a **memory dump**. I recommend using [ProcDump][proc-dump] from [Sysinternals][sysinternals]. You can set up rules to write a dump when certain conditions are met (i.e. exception thrown, CPU usage, memory usage...). The common use case is to write a dump using a `PID` (process Id):

```powershell
procdump64.exe -r -a -ma <process-id>
```

- `-ma`: write a 'Full' dump file
- `-r`: dump using a clone
- `-a`: avoid outage

:rotating_light: `ProcDump` comes as two flavours: `x86` and `x64`. You'll need to use the same bitness than the process you're capturing. If you use the incorrect bitness, the dump will be mostly unusable.

You can use a process name instead of a `PID`:

```powershell
procdump64.exe -ma <process-name>
```

:rotating_light: when running `ProcDump` for the first time you'll need to accept the `Sysinternals` license agreement:

```powershell
procdump64.exe -accepteula -ma <process-id>
```

:rotating_light: if you decide to use something else don't forget you need a **full** dump (instead of a **mini** dump).

## Download and install `WinDbg`

You can get `WinDbg` by getting the `WinDbg Preview` from the store (`Windows 10 Anniversary Update` and higher only) or installing the `Windows 10 SDK`.

### Store

If you're running `Windows 10 Anniversary Update` and higher you can install `WinDbg Preview` from the [store][windbg-store]. I wrote a [guide][windbg-preview-guide] about `WinDbg Preview`.

### Windows 10 SDK

Download the [Windows 10 SDK][windows-10-sdk].

In the installation wizard, select `Debugging Tools for Windows` and clear all the other components.

![Debugging Tools for Windows](assets/debugging-tools-windows.png)

`WinDbg` comes in two flavours: `x86` and `x64`. Both will be installed, when loading a dump make sure you select the one matching the bitness of your process.

## Analysing the dump on another machine

You'll need to get the following `DLL`s from the machine where the dump was written:

- `mscordacwks.dll`
- `SOS.dll`

They're located in the proper version of the `.NET framework`: `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework` for `x86` and `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64` for `x64`. The versions listed there are the `CLR` versions, you [can determine the CLR version based on the .NET version][dotnet-clr-versions].

Once you've downloaded the two `DLL`s you need to load them in `WinDbg`:

For `SOS`: `.load C:\path-to-dll\SOS.dll` (no output is expected)

For `mscordacwks`: `.cordll -lp C:\{directory-in-which-mscordacwks-is-located}`

- Do not include `mscordacwks.dll` in the path (i.e. if the location is `C:\dlls\mscordacwks.dll` the command should be `.cordll -lp C:\dlls`)
- The output should be `CLR DLL status: Loaded DLL {full-path-name}`

## Open a memory dump

`File` -> `Open Crash Dump...`

When opening the dump `WinDbg` will display the following information:

![Open memory dump](assets/windbg-load-dump.png)

Ensure you're working with a **full** dump and that `sympath` is as expected (see [Configure the symbols](#configure-the-symbols)).

## Configure the symbols

**sympath**: the location(s) where `WinDbg` will look for `symbols`.

Having `symbols` will make the debugging experience much nicer. When building, either publish your `PDB`s to a `symbols` server or store them as artifacts. Then when needed copy them to `C:\symbols\local` (or whatever you set your `sympath` to).

You can view the value of `sympath` by issuing the following command:

```text
.sympath
```

You can set `sympath` via a **setting**, **during the debugging session** or via an **environment variable**. If you want to know more, you can read [Symbol path for Windows debuggers][symbol-path-windows-debuggers].

### Setting

- Open the `File` menu -> Select `Symbol File Path ...`
- Enter the below in the textbox, select `Reload` and click `Ok`

```text
C:\symbols\local;srv*C:\symbols\microsoft*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
```

`File` -> `Save Workspace` will persist your `sympath`!

### During the session

You can load the `symbols` during the session:

```text
.sympath C:\symbols\local;srv*C:\symbols\microsoft*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
.reload
```

### Environment variable

- Variable name: `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH`
- Variable value: `C:\symbols\local;srv*C:\symbols\microsoft*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`

## Configure the source

- Open the `File` menu -> Select `Source File Path ...`
- Enter the below in the textbox, select `Reload` and click `Ok`

```text
C:\symbols\source
```

`File` -> `Save Workspace` will persist your `srcpath`!

## Recommended extensions

`WinDbg` is a bit dry but luckily extensions provide nifty commands.

### SOS

Load the `CLR` debugging extensions. Informally known as [Son of Strike][so-son-of-strike].

#### Full framework

```text
.loadby sos clr

## Commands

- regular commands (e.g.: `k`) debug processes
- dot commands (e.g.: `.sympath`)  control the debugger
- extension commands (e.g.: `!handle`) come from `WinDbg` extensions

### `MEX` commands

List `MEX` commands

```text
!mex.help
```

:star2: ASP.NET: short history of requests which have run and currently running requests

```text
!mex.aspxpagesext
```

## Working with managed memory

Get all the objects in the managed heaps. Bigger objects are at the bottom:

```text
!dumpheap -stat
```

Once you identified a problematic type:

```text
!dumpheap -typeÂ Full.Namespace.Type
```

What's keeping an object alive:

```text
!sosex.mroot <address>
```

See managed heaps:

```text
!eeheap -gc
```

## Working with unmanaged memory

Summary of memory by types:

```text
!address -summary
```

## Working with exceptions

Find all the exceptions on the heap:

```text
!dumpheap -type Exception -stat
```

Find the addresses of this exception:

```text
!dumpheap -type System.Threading.ThreadAbortException
```

Print exception using the address:

```text
!pe 0x01c601ac
```

See all exceptions of dump:

```text
!mex.dumpallexceptions
# Or if you're lazy:
!mex.dae
# Or if you want to see all types having "Exception" in their name:
!dumpheap -type Exception -stat
```

## Working with threads

:star2: List managed threads with what they're currently doing

```text
!mex.mthreads
```

Alternatively you can use `!sos.threads`

The first column is the thread `ID` which then can be used for all the commands below (i.e. in this case we're interested in thread `142`).

See what a managed thread is doing:

```text
~142e !sos.CLRStack
```

See what an unmanaged thread is doing:

```text
~142k
```

Switch to thread:

```text
~142s
```

:star2: :turtle: Group threads by unique stacks

```text
!mex.us
```

This command is great to identify all the threads doing the same thing (and potentially being blocked at the same point).

## Working with code

Disassemble:

```text
!U \d <address>
```

Displays a disassembly around the current instruction with interleaved source, `IL` and `ASM` code:

```text
!sosex.mu <address>
```

## Who is holding the lock

```text
0:000> !syncblk
Index         SyncBlock MonitorHeld Recursion Owning Thread Info          SyncBlock Owner
   52 20ee3118          229         2 20fc6ba0 9628  42   0a13ee8c System.Object
# Abbreviated
```

The third column (`MonitorHeld`) indicates how many threads are trying to acquire the same lock. In this case it is `(229 - 1) / 2 = 114`. You can read more about it in this `SO` [answer][so-monitor-held].

## Troubleshooting

`WinDbg` errors can be a bit cryptic. In this section I say `no more!`

### SOS mismatch

You might get an error when trying to load `SOS`:

```text
0:000> .loadby sos clr
The call to LoadLibrary(D:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\sos) failed, Win32 error 0n126
    "The specified module could not be found."
Please check your debugger configuration and/or network access.
```

This dump has been written on an Azure Web App and the path is pointing to a hard-drive somewhere in the cloud.

- Download the `SOS.dll` from the folder included in the error (`D:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\` in this case)
- Load the `SOS.dll` using this command: `.load C:\path-to-dll\SOS.dll`

### mscordacwks mismatch

You can see which `mscordacwks.dll` is loaded:

```text
0:000> .cordll
CLR DLL status: Loaded DLL c:\symbols\mscordacwks_x86_x86_4.7.2563.00.dll\5A334E146eb000\mscordacwks_x86_x86_4.7.2563.00.dll
```

### Missing command

```text
0:000> !runaway2
No export runaway2 found
```

You need to load the extension containing this command. A quick Google will identify the name of the extension.

### Bitness mismatch

This is what happens when you open a `32-bit` memory dump with `WinDbg (X64)`:

```text
0:000> .load C:\dumps\SOS.dll
The call to LoadLibrary(C:\dumps\SOS.dll) failed, Win32 error 0n193
    "%1 is not a valid Win32 application."
Please check your debugger configuration and/or network access.
```

Use `WinDbg (X86)` instead.

### OutOfMemoryException

`System.ExecutionEngineException`, `System.StackOverflowException` and `System.OutOfMemoryException` are created as soon as the process starts. This means that you will always see them on the heap even if they haven't been thrown.

See [Why do I see ExecutionEngineException, StackOverflowException and OutOfMemoryException on the heap?][why-eee-soe-oom].

### Symbols resolution

If some of your symbols are not loading as expected you can turn on debugging messages when `WinDbg` attempts to load symbols:

```text
!sym noisy
```

Once you're done, don't forget to reset it to its initial state:

```text
!sym quiet
```
